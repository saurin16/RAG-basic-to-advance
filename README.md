# üîç Advanced & Agentic RAG Techniques with LangChain, LangGraph, and Athina AI

This repository showcases advanced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques and their **agentic extensions**, designed to improve the factual accuracy, contextual relevance, and adaptability of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in production applications.

It offers **ready-to-use implementations**, detailed explanations, and evaluation methods to help researchers and developers build robust RAG systems without starting from scratch.

---

## üí° Why RAG?

While LLMs are powerful, they are limited by static training data. This often leads to:
- Outdated information
- Hallucinations (confident, incorrect responses)
- Poor performance on private or domain-specific content

**RAG** solves these problems by retrieving relevant external documents and injecting them into the model‚Äôs prompt. This approach ensures that the model generates responses grounded in up-to-date and reliable information.

---

## üîß RAG Architecture Overview

RAG systems consist of four core components:

1. **Indexing**  
   Documents (text, PDF, CSV, etc.) are chunked, embedded, and stored in a vector database (e.g., FAISS, ChromaDB, Weaviate).

2. **Retriever**  
   Relevant chunks are fetched using vector similarity or hybrid methods like BM25 + embeddings.

3. **Augmentation**  
   Retrieved documents are merged with the user query to build a rich, context-aware prompt.

4. **Generation**  
   The LLM (e.g., GPT-4, LLaMA, Claude) generates a final answer grounded in the augmented context.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced RAG Techniques

| Technique | Tools Used | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Naive RAG** | LangChain, Pinecone, Athina AI | Standard vector retrieval + prompt injection. |
| **Hybrid RAG** | LangChain, ChromaDB | Combines vector similarity with traditional search (BM25). |
| **HyDE RAG** | LangChain, Weaviate | Creates "hypothetical documents" to generate better embeddings for hard queries. |
| **Parent Document Retrieval** | LangChain, ChromaDB | Retrieves entire documents when any part of it is relevant. |
| **RAG Fusion** | LangChain, LangSmith, Qdrant | Uses query decomposition and ranking with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). |
| **Contextual RAG** | LangChain, ChromaDB | Compresses retrieved docs to only the most relevant information. |
| **Rewrite-Retrieve-Read** | LangChain, ChromaDB | Rewrites the query for better retrieval, then answers. |
| **Unstructured RAG** | LangGraph, Unstructured, FAISS | Handles mixed content (text + tables + images). |

## ü§ñ Agentic RAG Techniques

Agentic RAG combines the power of agents with RAG workflows. Agents can make decisions like retrieving, refining, reflecting, or rerouting queries based on context.

| Technique | Tools | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Basic Agentic RAG** | LangChain, FAISS | Simple agent uses tools (vector DB, web search) to retrieve + generate answers. |
| **Corrective RAG** | LangGraph, ChromaDB | Agents refine or remove noisy retrieved content and fetch new if needed. |
| **Self-RAG** | LangGraph, FAISS | The agent reflects on the initial answer and decides if more info is needed. |
| **Adaptive RAG** | LangGraph, FAISS | Dynamically switches between internal index and external sources (e.g., APIs, search). |
| **ReAct-RAG** | LangGraph, FAISS | Reasoning + Acting pattern for step-by-step decision making. |

## üìä RAG Evaluation with Athina AI

Evaluating RAG systems is critical for real-world use. This repo includes notebooks for:
- Accuracy and relevance scoring
- Hallucination detection
- Ranking quality evaluation
- End-to-end task performance (e.g., QA, summarization)

Evaluation helps developers measure and optimize RAG pipelines for production use.
